    The world is small, but the people aren't very close.
    50 faces is a slowcial network for connecting unconnected people and social groups.

   50 faces goal is to take the good pieces of modern social networking while leaving the bad.
   We emphasize
   conversation over show and tell,
   a few meaningful connections over hordes of followers,
   and a varied interconnected communities over exclusive clubs.
